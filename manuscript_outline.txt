In this study, we use the Australian radiation of blindsnakes as a system to investigate the diversification of morphologically conserved squamates by testing hypotheses about the processes that promote speciation. Specifically, we sought to answer the following questions:
(1) What is the ancestral biome of Australian _Anilios_? 
() Which biomes are the largest source and sinks of biodiversity? 
() What is the relationship between diversification rate and changes in paleo environment? 
() Which paleo environment best explain current phylogeny?
() Are there differences in diversification rates between lineages in arid and non-arid biome?

Aims: 
- Investigate the biogeographic history of Anilios and infer the ancestral biome of Australian blindsnakes based on near-complete phylogeny of extant taxa.

- Evaluate how paleo-environmental changes influence rates of diversification. 
- Assess model fit between paleo-environment.  

- Compare localised versus globalised temperature on the diversification of Australian blindsnake radiation, 

- Compare the rates of diversification between lineages in the arid versus non-arid biome. 

Aims: 
- Infer the ancestral biome of Australian blindsnakes based on near-complete phylogeny of extant taxa.
--- BioGEOBEARS infer tropical grassland biome as the ancestral biome
--- Ancestor to crown Anilios not clear because we don't have enough sampling to be confident. Placement of R. multilineatus as sister to Anilios not what we've seen before.
--- Tropical grassland also acted as species pump. Probably due to changes in environment as Australia aridify. 
--- Transition into arid biome predated aridification, big changes in habitat structure/connectivity as the landscape change may have isolated species (that have small range). 
--- According to our model, the northern part of Australia was colonised first and species moved south out from the arid biome into the mediterranean biome. 

- Investigate how paleo-environmental changes influence rates of diversification + Assess model fit between paleo-environment.  
--- Paleoclimate reconstructions based on DEM by Scotese and Straume were similar in profile. However, DEM base on Valdes differed from the other two. Scotese is characterised by repeated fluctuations in the Pleistocene to reflect glacial cycles. 
- Overall the average temperature from Australia specific reconstruction is consistently is warmer than global mean temperature. 
- In the context of our model might not have made much of a difference because our environment-dependent models fit the spline rather than absolute temperature. 
However, models that take in account thermal niche tolerance, such as NEMo, will benefit from paleoclimate reconstructions such as these to inform limits (boundaries). 
--- Aridity index is a good indicator, but aridity is geographically restricted to the arid zone. In our phylogeny, a lot of diversity is observed is in the mesic zones.
--- Warmer and dryer environment may not directly increase speciation rate because blind snakes are physically adapting to warmer temperatures, rather it is the fragmentation of the landscape. 
--- Thermal tolerance and preference for blind snakes remains unknown but fossorial species tend to live in pretty stable climate? 

- Compare the rates of diversification between lineages in the arid versus non-arid biome. .
--- Our result supports other data that indicate tropical grassland is a species pump
--- These results build on existing evidence of ....
--- Arid adapted lineages may have experienced higher extinction OR not well sampled in remote Western Australia. Most species are sampled next to roads (Xia's paper or do supplemental analyses).
--- Vast arid biome is  the largest biome in Australia with lots of heterogeneity (cite Mitzy's paper). Pockets of certain areas were refugia during glaciation cycles of the Pleistocene. 

--- Our results provide new insights on

  - High rates of diversification observed in concert with changing climate may be explained by allopatric speciation. 

Snippets:

-The arid biome is heterogenous and some areas have acted as refugia during glaciation [citations], which may cause isolation and subsequent speciation. For example, the Pilbara region has both lineages that have deep coalescent histories and shallower divergences (_A. ammodytes_ and _A. ganei_). These species may have once been widely distributed but became extirpated as aridification intensified and are now found only in their place of refuge during glacial fluctuations. 

-While there are currently no study that have investigated spatial ecology of blind snakes, we suspect blind snakes have small ranges and poor dispersal ability as closely related species occupy the same or nearby areas. Stochastic events like floods may have isolated different populations in different areas and restrict gene pools.

- Our study is the first to quantitatively assess the influence of aridity on the diversification rates of a group of vertebrate on a macroevolutionary scale.
