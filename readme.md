# Analyses for Australo-Papuan blind snake radiation and ancestral biome reconstruction

## Phylogeny
- Phylogeny are inferred MCMCTrees with slightly different date estimates.

## Diversification data
- The main objective is to fit diversfication models (RPANDA) to phylogeny of Australian blind snakes.

## Biogeography 
- data/WWF_Australia/  - contains distribution of blindsnakes from ALA and WWF Terrestrial Ecosystem/Biome shape files
- data/intermediate_data/ -- contains data that has been processed and will be used for cleaing up other data.
