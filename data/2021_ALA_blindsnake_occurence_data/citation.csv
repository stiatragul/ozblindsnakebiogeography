(Accessed: DD-MM-YYYY)","Creative Commons Attribution (International) (CC-BY 4.0 (Int))","For more information: https://collections.ala.org.au/public/show/dr8129","Location data is generalized to the sub-state boundary, full resolution locations are available from HerpMapper upon request for conservation and research purposes.","As you may know, one of the things that sets HerpMapper apart from many other citizen-science database projects is that point-location data entered into HerpMapper are not shared publicly by HerpMapper. As such, HerpMapper Partners are discouraged from sharing point-location data publicly, even for common species, but HerpMapper acknowledges that in some cases this may be necessary to meet conservation and research objectives. HerpMapper encourages Partners to contact HerpMapper directly to discuss publication and sharing of these data to meet your needs while also best protecting herpetofauna populations. This also ensures that multiple organizations do not attempt to publish the same new and updated county records in Herpetological Review geographical distribution notes.","","13"
