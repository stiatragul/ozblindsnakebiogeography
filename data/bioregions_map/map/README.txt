These shape files were used in the historical biogeography analyses presented in 

Tiatragul, S., Skeels, A., & Keogh, J. S. (2023). Paleoenvironmental models for Australia and the impact of aridification on blindsnake diversification. Journal of Biogeography, 50, 1899â€“1913. https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.14700

WWF Ecoregions shape files were downloaded originally from https://www.worldwildlife.org/biomes. However, as of 2023, files and data associated have been moved to https://www.oneearth.org/bioregions/ and can be downloaded at https://www.oneearth.org/announcing-the-release-of-ecoregion-snapshots/

New Guinea, Bismarck Archipelago + Solomon Islands, and Lesser Sundas were manually extracted from Natural Earth -- Admin 0-Countries (https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/) using QGIS (v. 3.22.10). CRS was set to EPSG:4326 - WGS 84. Carlos Pavon Vazquez helped me with initial preparation of the shape files.
